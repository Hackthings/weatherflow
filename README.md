# Weatherflow

An app that fetches and stores weather forecasts for the user.

### Getting started

Install development dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.
Once that finishes, you can run the test suite with `npm test`.

### To-Do
- [ ] Mock fetch requests to the weather api instead of hitting the network.
